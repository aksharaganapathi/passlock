# PassLock

UTDCS Cybersecurity Research Project

This group composes of Akshara Ganapathi, Giko Njendu, Jan de La Cruz and Yifan. 

The project is comprised of three main elements: a password generator, a password strength tester, and a password storage service. 

## Password Generator

The password generator can be found at: https://passlockpasswordgenerator.netlify.app/. The project was developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The website is able to randomly generate passwords using good security practices notably using symbols, varied letters and numbers in a random sequence. The website also features a copy paste functionality to make quality of life when using this site better.
