# PassLock

UTDCS Cybersecurity Research Project

This group composes of Akshara Ganapathi, Giko Njendu, Jan de La Cruz and Yifan Ma. 

The project is comprised of three main elements: a password generator, a password strength tester, and a password storage service. 

## Password Generator

The password generator can be found at: https://passlockpasswordgenerator.netlify.app/. The project was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website can randomly generate passwords using good security practices - notably using symbols, varied letters, and numbers in a random sequence. The website also features a copy-paste functionality to make the quality of life when using this site better.

## Password Strength Tester

The password generator can be found at: https://passlockpasswordstrengthtester.netlify.app/. The project was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website can take in a user's password, parse it, compare it against certain industry-standard conditions and alert the user if their password strength can be considered weak, medium, or strong. The website checks to see if the length of the password is sufficient, and if it has a good variety of symbols and letters.
