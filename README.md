# Password Strength Tester

The password generator can be found at: https://passlockpasswordstrengthtester.netlify.app/. The project was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website can take in a user's password, parse it, compare it against certain industry-standard conditions and alert the user if their password strength can be considered weak, medium, or strong. The website checks to see if the length of the password is sufficient, and if it has a good variety of symbols and letters.
